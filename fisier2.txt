Shrek 2 Script

  

                   

[man's voice] Once upon a time

in a kingdom far, far away,



 

                   

the king and queen were blessed

with a beautiful baby girl.



 

                   

And throughout the land,

everyone was happy...



 

                   

until the sun went down



 

                   

and they saw that their daughter was

cursed with a frightful enchantment



 

                   

that took hold each and every night.



 

                   

Desperate, they sought the help

of a fairy godmother



 

                   

who had them lock the young princess

away in a tower,



 

                   

there to await the kiss...

of the handsome Prince Charming.



  

                   

[horse whinnies]



  

                   

It was he who would chance

the perilous journey



  

                   

through blistering cold

and scorching desert



  

                   

traveling for many days and nights,



  

                   

risking life and limb



  

                   

to reach the Dragon's keep.



  

                   

[crows caw]



  

                   

For he was the bravest,



  

                   

and most handsome...



  

                   

in all the land.



  

                   

And it was destiny that his kiss



  

                   

would break the dreaded curse.



  

                   

He alone would climb to the highest room

of the tallest tower



  

                   

to enter the princess's chambers,

cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,



  

                   

pull back the gossamer curtains

to find her... [gasps]



  

                   

What?



  

                   

- Princess... Fiona?

- No!



  

                   

[sighs relief] Oh, thank heavens.

Where is she?



  

                   

- She's on her honeymoon.

- Honeymoon? With whom?



  

                   

- She's on her honeymoon.

- Honeymoon? With whom?



  

                   

[  Counting Crows: Accidentally In Love]



  

                   

  So she said

what's the problem, baby?



  

                   

  What's the problem?

I don't know



  

                   

  Well, maybe I'm in love



  

                   

  Think about it

every time I think 'bout it



  

                   

  Can't stop thinking 'bout it



  

                   

  How much longer

will it take to cure this?



  

                   

  Just to cure it,

'cause I can't ignore it



  

                   

  If it's love, love



  

                   

  Makes me wanna turn around

and face me



  

                   

  But I don't know nothing

'bout love



  

                   

  Oh, come on, come on



  

                   

- [screams]

-   Turn a little faster



  

                   

  Come on, come on



  

                   

  The world will follow after



  

                   

  Come on, come on



  

                   

  Everybody's after love



  

                   

  So I said

I'm a snowball running



  

                   

  Running down into this spring

that's coming all this love



  

                   

  Melting under blue skies

belting out sunlight



  

                   

  Shimmering love



  

                   

  Well, baby, I surrender



  

                   

  To the strawberry ice cream



  

                   

  Never ever end of all this love



  

                   

  Well, I didn't mean to do it



  

                   

  But there's no escaping your love



  

                   

  These lines of lightning

mean we're never alone



  

                   

  Never alone, no, no



  

                   

  Come on, come on



  

                   

  Jump a little higher



  

                   

  Come on, come on



  

                   

  If you feel a little lighter



  

                   

  Come on, come on



  

                   

  We were once upon a time in love



  

                   

Hyah!



  

                   

  We're accidentally in love



  

                   

  Accidentally in love



  

                   

  Accidentally in love



  

                   

  Accidentally in love



  

                   

  Accidentally in love



  

                   

  Accidentally in love



  

                   

  Accidentally in love



  

                   

  Accidentally



  

                   

  I'm in love, I'm in love,

I'm in love, I'm in love



  

                   

  I'm in love, I'm in love



  

                   

  Accidentally in love



  

                   

  I'm in love



  

                   

  I'm in love  



  

                   

It's so good to be home!



  

                   

- [distant singing]

- [giggling]



  

                   

Just you and me and...



  

                   

[Donkey sings]



  

                   

-   Two can be as bad as one...  

- Donkey?



  

                   

Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two

a sight for sore eyes!



  

                   

Give us a hug, Shrek,

you old love machine.



  

                   

[chuckles]



  

                   

And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.

How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?



  

                   

Donkey, what are you doing here?
